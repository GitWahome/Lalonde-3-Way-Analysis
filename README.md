# Lalonde-3-Way-Analysis
R- Analytics of the Lalonde 3 ways dataset.
While a lot of the analytics is alright, the regressions will need further refinement and generalization to validate the inference. There is extensive documentation to explain what is happening and offer modules for use when doing further analysis. 
The pdf is my analysis of the results, a memo addressed to Alexis J Diamond, my proffesor and one of the world's foremost experts in Statistical analyiss. This was graded 3.8/4
